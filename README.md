# MobyDicks

![Moby Dick](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Moby_Dick_p510_illustration.jpg)

This is a collection of **works/ideas that are related to ML**.

Most works here are short notebooks of ideas that stuck like brain-worms and needed scratching.
In 95% of the time these resulted in simple/interesting findings, but mainly incomplete works.

I will try to loosely group them in appropriate folders and add a header cell/comment with details on the status and their outcome.

Feel free to reach out if anyone is interested in working on these.

The naming is a convention following the theme of Id√©e fixe, with Moby Dick being the fixation of Ahab.
